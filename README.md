This Secure Banking Application is built using Spring Boot and Spring Security, with a strong emphasis on securing all API endpoints through JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. The application implements robust user authentication and role-based access control, ensuring that sensitive operations are accessible only to authorized users. Passwords are securely hashed using BCrypt, and comprehensive exception handling is integrated to manage authentication and authorization errors effectively. The project also includes API documentation via Swagger, alongside unit and integration tests to validate functionality and security. This application serves as a comprehensive example of modern security practices in financial applications.
